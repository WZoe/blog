> What steps do you take to resolve a problem?

1.	When I encounter a problem, firstly I will estimate how difficult it is. Is it some topic I am familiar with? Or is it an unfamiliar problem in familiar field? Or, something I have never heard of? To better understand it, sufficient research should be done in advance and visiting people who know about this area can be inspiring.

2.	Secondly, I will try to learn relevant knowledge about that field and try to figure out where the problem is actually pointing at. Which part of the problem requires most work? Which part is the most difficult?

3.	Then, I will recall my knowledge base and search for similar problems in my mind which can help me resolve this one with similar thinking patterns and processes. They may ressemble in any way you can think of. Need some connection and imagination.

4.	With these preparations, probably there can be several ways possible to resolve the problem. Then I will choose the best one to implement. If something goes wrong, think about what cause 'bugs' and improve it. Every time I fix a bug, I can get a better comprehension and avoid successive bugs. Or maybe I realize from half way that this way is blocked. Just reflect on my defeat, leverage the exprience and try a better method.

5. Problem solved! Again, learn from experiences. Conclude and move on for the next challenge!
